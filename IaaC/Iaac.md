   - Course Introduction

- Introduction to Infrastructure as Code
   - Challenges with Traditional IT Infrastrucure
   - Types of IaaC Tools
   - Why Terraform



-   Challenges with CF and ARM
        
     -    Everything dumped in single File
     -    Complex to Read the code. CF is Okay but ARM is pathetic
     -    Importing manually created resources in to IaC is complex
     -    Dry run came recently and not that effective
     -    CF is slow... ARM is slow than CF
     -    CF only work with AWS and ARM only with Azure
     -    Creating Multiple resource is complex in CF but ARM has functions
   
-   Advantages of Terraform
    -  Distribute the code with multiple files
    -  Reading code is easy
    -  It is very easy to create multiple resources 
    -  Import of resource is easy
    -  Terraform is Fast
    -  We can modularize the code.
    -  Semi Cloud agnostic

 - Disadvantages
      
    -  Bugs
    -
