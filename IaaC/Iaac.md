# Iaac or Iac

-   Challanges with CF and ARM
        
        1.  Everything dumped in single File
        2.  Complex to Read the code. CF is Okay but ARM is pathetic
        3.  Importing manually created resources in to IaC is complex
        4.  Dry run came recently and not that effective
        5.  CF is slow... ARM is slow than CF
        6.  CF only work with AWS and ARM only with Azure
